# CrystalPHP
Modular Hybrid Heirachical MVC Framework. Use which module you prefer

More than CodeIgniter because its bit too less
and Less than Laravel because sometimes its too much for little needs
CrystalPHP is framework you need for all your needs.

Initially inspired from AbanteCart, CodeIgniter and Laravel. As I have tried all of them.


#How it works ?
Step 1. Load Application and Initialize app. Parse the Request

Step 2. Load all the Route files and Parse the request route. 
run the logic defined in route's callback 

Step 3.(Optional) for MVC structure : Dispatch the controller using MVC logic. The MVC logic of CrystalPHP is well crafted to give Heirarchical and modular functionality. Reference the examples 

Step 3.(Optional) for REST APIs : in built functionality to send REST response in minimal lines as possible

Step 4.Send output compressed and clean if enabled 


Yet to implement : 
- Cache Mechanism
- Encrypted Responses
