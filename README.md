# CrystalPHP
The CrystalPHP Framework. A Flexible MVC Framework by Crystal Collective.

Inspired from CodeIgniter, Laravel and AbanteCart.

## Why?
- CodeIgniter - Simple, Easy but development is slow
- Laravel - Swiss Knife, means sometimes its too much for little needs.
**CrystalPHP lies somewhere in middle of both**

##Current Features 
- Route Based Response, Fast Routing
- Modular MVC structure with Nested or Hierarchical MVC(HMVC) support
- Easy REST API implementation
- Hybrid of MVC and REST support
- SEO tools
- Uses Laravel Eloquent for Database Interaction
- Many More to be Added ...

##How it works ? 
- **Step 1.** Load Application and Initialize app. Parse the Request
- **Step 2.** Load all the Route files and Parse the request route. run the logic defined in route's callback
- **Step 3.(Optional) for MVC structure** : Dispatch the controller using MVC logic. The MVC logic of CrystalPHP is well crafted to give Heirarchical and modular functionality. Reference the examples
- **Step 3.(Optional) for REST APIs** : in built functionality to send REST response in minimal lines as possible
- **Step 4.** Send output compressed and clean if enabled

##Coming Very Soon :
- Cache Mechanism
- Encrypted Responses
- Real time event Broadcasting
- Auth Library for easy verification
- Role Based Authorization
